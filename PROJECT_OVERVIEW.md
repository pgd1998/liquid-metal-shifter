# Liquid Metal Shape Shifter
## Intelligent Interactive Fluid Simulation

### <¯ Project Vision

An advanced 3D liquid metal simulation that responds intelligently to user interactions. This isn't just a blob that deforms - it's a **responsive digital entity** that learns, remembers, and evolves based on how users interact with it. Perfect for showcasing cutting-edge shader programming, real-time physics, and interactive design skills.

### >à Core Concept

**"Living Metal Intelligence"**

The liquid metal behaves like an intelligent organism:
- **Learns** your interaction patterns and preferences
